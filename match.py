    Our mission is to democratize software creation by enabling anyone to build the tools that meet their needs.
    We believe software is the most important innovation of the past century, but that its potency as a medium for economic value creation and creative expression remains inaccessible to most. (People typically experience a finished software product rather than software as a medium.) We believe customer success isnâ€™t the responsibility of a single team: instead, we all own this. In everything we do, we start with the customer and work backwards. When our customers succeed, we succeed. As engineers, we know how empowering it can be to create software, and we intend to bring this power to everyone.
    Instead of designing features for narrow use cases, we create fundamental building blocks that can be assembled to model any workflow. With our next-generation app platform, teams easily develop and deploy flexible and engaging apps that power critical workflows for teams. Our users can build powerful apps using our App designer, without requiring any special technical skills. Our platform makes it effortless to create an easy to use UI, powerful workflows, and scalable data structures. We strive to make complexity as accessible as possible, sweating the details of our user interface and creating the best possible experience even when it means more work up front.
